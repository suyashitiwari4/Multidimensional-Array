# Objective:To study and implement 2D arrays in C++ for storing and processing data (Matrix operations).

# Apparatus / Software Required:
VS code

# Theory:
Theory:
A 2D array is a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.
It is declared as:
data_type array_name[rows][columns];

Rows: Horizontal arrangement of elements.

Columns: Vertical arrangement of elements.

Example:
int matrix[3][3]; — A 3×3 integer array.

2D arrays are commonly used to store matrices, tables, and grids.
They are accessed using two indices:
matrix[i][j] → Element in the ith row and jth column.
